- document.createElement lets you create any HTML element but you have to specify it. 
- remember to introduce it as a variable. 

element.innerText - takes the value of todo1 and places it in the div you've just created. 

document.body.appendChild(element); - display the div on your page. 

- You can find array methods by typing the array name followed by a period (for example todos.)

- In Javascript, strings have methods too.
